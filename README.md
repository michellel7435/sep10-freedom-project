# SEP10 Freedom Project
By **Michelle Li**

## Context
I am a student at [HSTAT](https://www.hstat.org/) in the [Software Engineering Program](https://hstatsep.github.io/). The "Freedom Project" for SEP10 is a year-long project all about making a website that informs the viewer of the current and future innovations in the topic of my choosing.

For my project, I chose the topic of **neuroendoscopy**. 

I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, and Github. I also chose to independently study **A-Frame** in order to help me make by website.

## Purpose Of My Project
The purpose of my project was to help neurosurgeons with future technologies that are more advanced than the ones we have today. My project will be filled with todayâ€™s technologies and the future innovations with much information about it. My project is about the brain, ways that can help the brain with advancements of tools.
