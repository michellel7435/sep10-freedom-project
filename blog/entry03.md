# Entry 3: Neuroendoscopy
##### 12/22/23

## Content 
I mainly focused on brainstorming part B and finalizing my content. For this I was able to add on to part A (researching hardware and software technologies), what I was able to add on was future innovation for my topic. 
Future innovations that I came up with is a **high brain tech scanner** which would allow us to give a clear scan of the brain, also providing a high quality picture. This innovation can also provide us with important information about the brain that was scanned. **An improvement AI scanner** is another future innovation I came up with. As you know AI is intelligent but with this AI, it is going to be an improvement of the original AI which can be more efficient and beneficial. This AI would allow more accuracy when giving information and images about the brain, also including the problem with the solution. This could also make a 3D model of the brain. I also decided to talk about how there should be **a website about future innovation and [3D models](https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=597807857&rlz=1CASFJY_enUS1024&q=3d+model+of+the+brain&tbm=isch&source=lnms&sa=X&sqi=2&pjf=1&ved=2ahUKEwjv-fWbj9iDAxUWD1kFHYuCBvQQ0pQJegQIDRAB&biw=1366&bih=660&dpr=1&safe=active&ssui=on#imgrc=D-bSsN0KrvCvrM)**. With this website it could benefit minds, like doctors, surgeons, etc. This would include a high tech 3D printer 
and more efficient tools (ex. AI) on sight. Along with a website, there should also be **an app that has visuals of the brain with the [common problems](https://www.healthline.com/health/brain-disorders)**. This app would be really informative as well telling you what you should do and what you should not do.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
Currently, I am in the engineering design process's third stage stage, where brainstorming possible solutions is the process. I intend to find the solutions to curing brain problems such as brain cancer. WIth this I needed to find tools from present day and future innovation that can be more efficient to being the solution to curing brain problems.

## Skills 

#### Organization
I was able to develop this skill because when I was brainstorming part B and finalizing my content, everything was messy and research/information were out of place which got me so confused on what's what. I was able to organize my unorganized notes and turn it into something neater bullet points. This benefitted my workspace and my work because without this, everything would've been a mess and I wouldn't even find anything that I was looking for. For example, my notes used to be so cluttered up with links that I don't know where it leads too. I was able to solve this by typing a specific word about the link and linking my URL to the text helps me know what that URL is.

#### Creativity
I was able to increase my creativity throughout this. At first I was really lost to think about what else to add to my notes. For example, the future innovations for my topic, neuroendoscopy, I didn't know what software or hardwares technology existed already and I needed to come up with new technology. Coming up with new technology that doesn't exist is hard so what I did was talk about a hardware technology such as the MRI and upgrade it into a better and more efficient one with more knowledge.

#### Time management
I was able to develop this because I am usually busy after school. So what I do is try to finish any work/HW I have during school so there is less work for me to do at home because of my lack of time management. This was able to benefit my time and give me more time to work on things I have outside schools while being able to focus on schoolwork/HW.This also helps with my work being done efficiently and not rushed.

## Next Step
For my next steps I would like to plan out my layout and make it creative.
