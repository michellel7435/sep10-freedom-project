## Content 
I mainly focused on brainstorming part B and finializing my content. For this I was able to add on to part A (researching hardware and sofeware technologies), what I was able to add on was future innovation for my topic. 
Future innovations that I came up with is a **high brain tech scanner** which would allow us to give a clear scan of the brain, also providing a high quality picture. This innovation can also provide us which important information about the brain that was scanned. **An improvement AI scanner** is another future innovation I came up with. As you know AI is inteligent but with this AI, it is going to be an improvemnt of the original AI which can be more efficent and benefcial. This AI would allow more accuracy when giving information and images about the brain, also including the problem with the solution. This could also make a 3D model of the brain. I also decided to talk about how there should be **a website about future innovation and 3D models**. With this website it could benefit minds, like doctors, suregeons, etc. This would include a high tech 3D printer 
and more efficient tools (ex. AI) on sight. Along with a website, there should also be **an app that has visuals of the brain with the common problems**. This app would be really informative as well telling you what you should do and what you should not do.



## Skills 

#### Organization
I was able to develop this skill because when I was brainstorming part B and finializing my content, everything was messy and research/information were out of place which got me so confused on whats what. I was able to organize my unorganized notes and turn it into something neater which bullet points. This benefitted my workspace and my work because without this, everything would've been a mess and I wouln't even find anything that I was looking for. For example, my notes used to be so clutter up with links that I don't know where it leads too. I was able to solve this by typing a specific word about the link and link my URL to the text helps me know what that URL is.
