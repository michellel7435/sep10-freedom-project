## Content 
I mainly focused on brainstorming part B and finializing my content. For this I was able to add on to part A (researching hardware and sofeware technologies), what I was able to add on was future innovation for my topic. 
Future innovations that I came up with is a **high brain tech scanner** which would allow us to give a clear scan of the brain, also providing a high quality picture. This innovation can also provide us which important information about the brain that was scanned. **An improvement AI scanner** is another future innovation I came up with. As you know AI is inteligent but with this AI, it is going to be an improvemnt of the original AI which can be more efficent and benefcial. This AI would allow more accuracy when giving information and images about the brain, also including the problem with the solution. This could also make a 3D model of the brain.
