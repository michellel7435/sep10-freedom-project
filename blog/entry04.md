I had to choose between many tool options that I can use for my freedom project. I narrowed it down to 3 tools that I efound more interesting/easy to do. The top 3 options I chose was aframe, sass, and foundation, I researched and watched videos of all of these tools which brings me to the tool that I want to do the most, aframe. I chose Aframe because when researching on it looking through all the information, I found it easy to do and it would be fun to do it. I also was able to tinker with the information I found, I was able to try this code in JSBin.This tool is actcually really easy to use because I was able to understand everythign when researching on it. I'm planning to use aframe as my main tool for this project.

In JSBin I was able to test out the code for myself as shown below. The blocks (the circle and square) are able to move when I click the arrows (up, down, left, right) to the direction I am clicking the arrow.
