# Entry 6: Neuroendoscopy
##### 05/01/23

## Content
After months of learning codes and my tool I have finally started my website about my topic neuroendoscopy. When starting my website I had to make a wireframe, a layout plan, for mobile and desktop screens. At first I had an idea in my head but when I was planning it down, I realized it would be hard for me to code so I changed the layout to something more easier and understandable to do. My wireframe plan layout for mobile is [mobile layout plan](https://wireframe.cc/m4VvUw) and desktop is [desktop layout plan](https://wireframe.cc/USUlpy). Once I did my layout planning I was able to start on my website. The first thing I did was trying to understand how I would want to start my layout and which part I should start from first. Then I decided to do my sections first so it could be more organized and easy for me just to insert my texts and images in. After I used the bootstrap component, the carousel so my images are in. I struggled with the images because I wasn’t able to just insert the link and I had to save the image from scratch and put it in my IDE. I struggled with getting my images to work because I forgot how to go up a folder to get access to my image and I went down. I was able to fix this mistake by carefully looking at my code and trying the code in different ways so it can work. Then I did rows and columns and I was so confused with the rows and columns because I was using a basic template and there were a lot of codes already inserted in the HTML and CSS file. I was able to figure out some of the rows and columns and I was able to add all my content in almost matching to my layout format. THe font of the text was so confusing, I had no idea why it doesn’t work on some of the text and the text not aligning with the right font. I couldn't figure out why it wasn’t working so I left it alone for now and I wanted to try to use my tool. For my tool A Frame, I needed to use blender as well to create my 3D object but I did not understand how to use blender at all and it was stressing me out. I watched so many tutorials and I still was unable to get it so I also left it alone for now and tried to make my website better.

## Websites and Videos
There are many videos and websites I have used when creating my website. Websites and videos I used were related to my topic/tool and some are when I am struggling and I don’t understand what I am doing. A video I used was [Blender Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B0J27sf9N1Y) which I used to help me with blender but I didn’t really understand it so I kept trying to find a video that could help me and try to relate it to my topic. This video [Brain](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7koiCppOm0o) was able to help me understand how to make a brain but the tools were so confusing and it didn’t work out so I tried putting those 2 videos together and tried to comprehend both of them. I also struggled on the components so I used [Explain the components of Bootstrap](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/explain-the-components-of-bootstrap/) to help me understand the components more and help me understand the code instead of being confused. Rows and columns were so confusing me so I was looking at [Rows and Columns](https://www.library.illinois.edu/wp-training/shortcodes/rows-and-columns/) for more information about it and that website actually benefited me because it became easier for me to use rows and column.




## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
For the engineering design process, I am currently up to plan and design. I started off planning how I wanted my website to look like on mobile first design and desktop design then I started designing my website and adding things into it. When planning first it helps me be organized and makes things fasting for me to make my website.

## Skills 

#### Time management
A skill I was able to enhance was time management because I was able to save so much time with all my work and still have free time after. I would always try to finish all my work early and when I have free time so it doesn't stress me out when I have a lot of work stacked on top of each other and when I do it whenever I am free, it saves me so much time to do my work more efficiently and better. This was able to benefit my work and helped me out with other stuff I had to do.
#### Attention to detail
This skill I was able to learn because when coding there will be so many mistakes made. What I tend to do is pay attention to every code I typed and try to remember the code if I know it is wrong so when I run a preview of my code and something doesn’t work, I already have an idea of what went wrong. TIme to time there would be a lot of typos in my work so I double check everything and go through it slowly so I can know what I did wrong and look for the mistake. This was able to benefit me because it allowed me to have less typos and mistakes and gives me more time to comprehend things.


## Next Steps
For my next step I would love to work on my model and my font for my website and make it better and interactive. I want to make my website the best.
