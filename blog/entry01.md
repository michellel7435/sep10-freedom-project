# Entry 1: Neuroendoscopy
##### 10/23/23

## Neuroendoscopy, why?: 
For my year-long project, my project I had chosen is **neuroendoscopy**. Neuroendoscopy focuses on the brain, spine and the nervous system. For my project I will be focusing on the brain. I chose this topic because I have observed the brain through videos and researches which led me to think "how does the brain actually function and how do some brain end up with brain tumor?". These questions made me interested in choosing the brain as my topic for the year-long project.  Although there are answers, I want to go deeper into these questions and what technologies do people use to examine the functions of the brain. As well with this project, I am hoping to learn more interesting facts and being able to share my knowledge with other people who also have curosities. My alternative options were Law and Finance Management. They were my alternative options because I also had interest in them however neuroendoscopy was more impressive.

## Sources
Two links that I use to observe was ["Neuroendoscopy"](https://www.moffitt.org/cancers/brain-cancer/treatment/surgery/neuroendoscopy/) which tells me the what neuroendoscopy and how it can be performed, and ["Brain tumor"](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-tumor/symptoms-causes/syc-20350084) which tells me how the brian tumor grows and there are many types of different tumors but some are not cancerous. Some other links I had observe was ["Brain Surgery"](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/16802-brain-surgery) and ["Neuroendoscopy: history, endoscopes, and instrumentation"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00381-023-06090-0) which both gives me more information to help me with my other sources.

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
Currently, I am in the engineering design process's first stage, where identifying the problem is the process. I intend to use my project for solving this particular problem. The problem I want to solve is how do we understand how does a brain tumor actually happens. I want to inform people about the problem. I am now researching on information to help me solve my problem.

## Skills 

#### Attention to detail
Paying attention to details is a skill that i had develop. Being able to pay attention can help me find mistakes in my writings or problems and I can be able to fix that easily. Also, paying attention to details can help me find specfic facts or information when it comes to reading articles or stories that will help me with my project. It is important for me to use this skill because it  minimize errors, improved my quality of work, avoid overlooking mistakes, and catching mistakes early on instead of fixing it later on.

#### Time management


#### Organization

## Professionalism
