# Entry 1: Neuroendoscopy
##### X/X/XX

Text
## Neuroendoscopy, why?: 
For my year-long project, my project I had chosen is **neuroendoscopy**. Neuroendoscopy focuses on the brain, spine and the nervous system. For my project I will be focusing on the brain. I chose this topic because I have observed the brain through videos and researches which led me to think "how does the brain actually function and how do some brain end up with brain tumor?". These questions made me interested in choosing the brain as my topic for the year-long project.  Although there are answers, I want to go deeper into these questions and what technologies do people use to examine the functions of the brain. As well with this project, I am hoping to learn more interesting facts and being able to share my knowledge with other people who also have curosities. My alternative options were Law and Finance Management. They were my alternative options because I also had interest in them however neuroendoscopy was more impressive.

## Sources
Two links that I use to observe was ["Neuroendoscopy"](https://www.moffitt.org/cancers/brain-cancer/treatment/surgery/neuroendoscopy/) which tells me the what neuroendoscopy and how it can be performed, and ["Brain tumor"](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/brain-tumor/symptoms-causes/syc-20350084) which tells me how the brian tumor grows and there are many types of different tumors but some are not cancerous. Some other links I had observe was ["Brain Surgery"](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/treatments/16802-brain-surgery) and ["Neuroendoscopy: history, endoscopes, and instrumentation"](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00381-023-06090-0) which both gives me more information to help me with my other sources.
