## Content
After all the coming up with a topic, researching my topic, planning on how i want my website to be, learning countless codes and new things, learning my tool A Frame, presenting my project to the class and during the expo, I was finally done with everything. During this whole year I was able to learn a lot of new things that were able to benefit me during my school year. Such as the presentation about my finished project on Neuroendoscopy. I have learned so many new things from it. Also during the expo I was able to take what I presented in class and use it during my expo elevator pitch.                                             

In Class Presentation Takeaways: 
* I forgot everything I was going to say which messed me up but I still kept going
* I was able to show more and explaining my website more
* What I took away was being loud and being confident in myself
* Giving direct contact
* Be mindful of the time I had to present
* Trying my best to present
* Taking the feedback and working on it

Expo Takeaways:
* I had to be loud and make sure my elevator pitch was interesting
* Understanding what the judge wants to hear and see
* I should look directly at them when presenting my work
* Make sure my thing was summarize enough and was informative yet good for presentation
* Knowing your speech well, remembering it can help during the presentation
* When I memorized what I had to say during the presentation I was able to be confident in myself and it allowed me to speak loudly and clear
* Making sure my presentation wasn’t too long or pass the 1 minute mark

## Engineering Design Process (EDP)
For the engineering design process, I am currently up to improve as needed. I already did everything, such as presenting my project in the expo and getting the feedback from the judges and the people who were listening alone to my projects. Using the feedback such as presenting it louder and more confident which can help me during my future presentation. I started off sharing but through many feedbacks and many confidence boosts I was ready to be the best at presenting.

## Skills 

#### Embracing failure
Embracing failure was able to help me notice that messing up is never bad, it always takes many tries to get it right or do something right. Embracing failure has given me the opportunity to get people’s opinion about what I should do better or what to change with my work which allows me to learn from others so I can do better next time. Embracing failure is so beneficial to me because nobody is perfect to always get things right without failures.

#### Creativity
Another thing I was able to gain was creativity because during this whole project, I was able to open my mind into something more beyond and think of ways that can make my project look better. With creativity it was able to help me understand different new concepts of codes and skills that were able to make my website stand out and look better than ever. Creativity also help me encourage myself into doing more things and making things more complex than it was supposed to be.
