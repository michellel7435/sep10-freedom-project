# Entry 5
##### 4/11/24

The tool I chose was Aframe and I was given almost a month to learn about it so I can use it for my year long project (neuroendoscopy). During the given time I would watch youtube tutorials, go through pages related to the topic, testing out the code, and marking what I did in my IDE so I know what I am on and what I am doing. I was able to learn a lot about aframe throughout this whole month. A website I was going through was [Aframe- Animation](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/guides/building-a-basic-scene.html), when I was going this website I was trying to learn how animation were used and how to use it. I was learning the code and with the code given I would put it in JSBin to test it out and mess around with it. Another website I used was [Aframe-Shapes](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/components/geometry.html) when I was going through I was trying to see the different kind of shapes and see if I can make my own shape. Then I watched multiple videos on different types of aframe such as [Interactions With Aframe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM89f0GLzB0), [Aframe lighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GEvyHcy-og), [Aframe- Model Loading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9uAXlrPUzs), [Transformation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjSaTiGs0Js), [Texture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4PInDvyOFw), and [Custom Imaging/Curving Image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ze6nF_QB-8). I was able to learn many different things about aframe and try to understand and test these out. There are so many parts to aframe where it gets so confusing at times because I would have to try to learn all of them and see which one would fit my freedom project on the brain and a high tech machine. Learning those parts were also hard to comprehend because there is so much I need to take in just to make a code.

When the month started I began to test out a given code in [Introduction of Aframe](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/). I would use the code in the website and put it in JSBin to see what I was working with, it popped up some 3D shapes which was really cool. Then when I was going through the code I would try to understand and mess around with it and learn more about how aframe would work. I would always try to tinker more on it and add new lines of code to see what fits and what that specific code does. Below this would be an image of a code I tried doing in the beginning of the month.

I would watch more videos and learn more about aframe such as learning animation on each shape where a specific shape I choose can move on its own on a loop to a specific place. When doing this, I didn’t find any trouble but the positioning because I do not know where it will stop so I was messing around with it and eventually I got it.

There are more things I learned such as trying to make my own 3D shapes and I also tried to import a code into my IDE for an example and see what I needed to do to make my code become like that. I also learned how to add shadows and try to import a background but that didn’t work really well so I was trying to watch more videos. Using aframe was complicated at first but when I started understanding through videos, asking my friends and the teacher, and researching I was able to comprehend aframe better which allowed me to do codes like that.

## Skills 

#### Time management
When learning my tool I was also busy with other classes homework and outside of the school work. Time to time I would be so busy where I have to do everything in one day because everyday is due on the next day. So I was able to fix my time management by doing some easy work during my free periods/time so I can preserve time when I'm outside of school. When doing my work inside of school I was able to save myself a lot of time where I can get all my work efficiently done and I didn’t have to worry about giving in late. I would try to finish what I can during school so I can have more free time outside of school. This was able to benefit my time because I would be able to sleep earlier and have time for myself and outside of school problems. Doing this wasn’t hard as well, it was pretty easy and it isn’t time consuming.

#### Organization
I had to be organized when doing this because things can get really messy if nothing is in place. There’s time when I was so busy I started putting whatever I had and it wasn’t really organized and it stresses me out just by looking at it and it also stresses me out when I'm trying to find something but it’s so messy till the point I can’t. When being organized it can keep your notes cleaner and easier to find. This can benefit your time as well because you don’t have to keep searching through things for hours just not to find it but when you are organized everything will be aligned and in place.

## Next Steps
For my step I would love to learn more about my tool and start doing more complex codes where my freedom project will go above and beyond.
