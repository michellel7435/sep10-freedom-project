The tool I chose was Aframe and I was given almost a month to learn about it so I can use it for my year long project (neuroendoscopy). During the given time I would watch youtube tutorials, go through pages related to the topic, testing out the code, and marking what I did in my IDE so I know what I am on and what I am doing. I was able to learn a lot about aframe throughout this whole month. A website I was going through was [Aframe- Animation](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/guides/building-a-basic-scene.html), when I was going this website I was trying to learn how animation were used and how to use it. I was learning the code and with the code given I would put it in JSBin to test it out and mess around with it. Another website I used was [Aframe-Shapes](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/components/geometry.html) when I was going through I was trying to see the different kind of shapes and see if I can make my own shape. Then I watched multiple videos on different types of aframe such as [Interactions With Aframe](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yM89f0GLzB0), [Aframe lighting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7GEvyHcy-og), [Aframe- Model Loading](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h9uAXlrPUzs), [Transformation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AjSaTiGs0Js), [Texture](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A4PInDvyOFw), and [Custom Imaging/Curving Image](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ze6nF_QB-8). I was able to learn many different things about aframe and try to understand and test these out. There are so many parts to aframe where it gets so confusing at times because I would have to try to learn all of them and see which one would fit my freedom project on the brain and a high tech machine. Learning those parts were also hard to comprehend because there is so much I need to take in just to make a code.
