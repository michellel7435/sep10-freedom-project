What I tried
* I tried the HTML code example in [Aframe](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) by putting it in JSBin to see what it does so I can get an example.
* Progess I was able to make is understanding the basics of aframe.

Challenges
* Challenges I had was understanding the texture and images because it was really hard for me to understand the code eample given and I did not know which one was for the texture.

Questions
* How may I use aframe to make a 3d model of the brain?
* How do I make this interactive?

What I will try next
* What I will try next is to try to make my own instead of using HTML code examples.

What I tried
* I tried to tinker around and try to make my own code by doing the same formatting of [Aframe](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) but trying to make every shape moveable and interactive.
* Progress I was able to make is learning how to make each shape from the format move even if it does work as well


Challenges
* Challenges I had was understanding the how to make each object moveable and understanding what I am doing so it won't feel as messy so I try to stay organize with my code. It took me so long to understand how to make a single shape move so I can use it as a model for my freedom project.

Questions
* Is it possible for me to have a 3D model brain?
* How can I make this so people can interact with my work?

What I will try next
* What I will try next is adding more and doing the same thing so I can understand the code more.

What I tried:
* This time I tried to be more creative and try to do objects that are related to the topic I tired.
* I also tried new codes such as adding more different object making them all move seperately.

Challenges:
* I had problem understaning the movements but I was eventually able to get it in the end using videos and researching.

What I will try next:
* Next time i would like to do my layout, basically starting my project a little.

03/21/24:
What I tried:
* This time I tried to be more creative and added color and try doing a different shape to match the topic I chose
* I also tried to add shadow to my objects to make it look more realistic

Challenges:
* I had problems when trying to add a diffrent shape with texture

What I will try next:
- Next time I will try to go above and beyond with my code and make it more better

03/25/24:
What I tried:
* I tired to make a background color that fits my code space trying to make the shape have a shadow on it so it looked more realistic.

Challenges:
* When doing this, I messed up on my code a little which made me confused and lost because the code wasn't work but eventually I figured it out.

What I will try next:
* What I will try next is that I want to make some text when the shape is moved over there
