What I tried
* I tried the HTML code example in [Aframe](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) by putting it in JSBin to see what it does so I can get an example.
* Progess I was able to make is understanding the basics of aframe.

Challenges
* Challenges I had was understanding the texture and images because it was really hard for me to understand the code eample given and I did not know which one was for the texture.

Questions
* How may I use aframe to make a 3d model of the brain?
* How do I make this interactive?

What I will try next
* What I will try next is to try to make my own instead of using HTML code examples.

What I tried
* I tried to tinker around and try to make my own code by doing the same formatting of [Aframe](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) but trying to make every shape moveable and interactive.
* Progress I was able to make is learning how to make each shape from the format move even if it does work as well


Challenges
* Challenges I had was understanding the how to make each object moveable and understanding what I am doing so it won't feel as messy so I try to stay organize with my code. It took me so long to understand how to make a single shape move so I can use it as a model for my freedom project.

Questions
* Is it possible for me to have a 3D model brain?
* How can I make this so people can interact with my work?

What I will try next
* What I will try next is adding more and doing the same thing so I can understand the code more.
