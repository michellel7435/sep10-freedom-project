What I tried
* I tried the HTML code example in [Aframe](https://aframe.io/docs/1.5.0/introduction/) by putting it in JSBin to see what it does so I can get an example.
* Progess I was able to make is understanding the basics of aframe.

Challenges
* Challenges I had was understanding the texture and images because it was really hard for me to understand the code eample given and I did not know which one was for the texture.

Questions
* How may I use aframe to make a 3d model of the brain?
* How do I make this interactive?

What I will try next
* What I will try next is to try to make my own instead of using HTML code examples.
